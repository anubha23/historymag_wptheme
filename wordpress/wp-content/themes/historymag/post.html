<p>Both print and electronic media have reported in recent weeks a number of
conferences on Sanskrit language and culture. Promoting the study of Sanskrit
language and texts are laudable efforts. Sanskrit has bequeathed to us wonderful
literary treasures. However, the principal agenda of these conferences is not
always the promotion of Sanskrit but establishing other perspectives of a
problematic kind.<p>

<p>One persistently hears the persistent and shrill claim that Sanskrit and Sanskritic
culture are the very bedrock of traditional, unadulterated and pristine Indian
culture, which has been prevalent from time immemorial, but which needs an
urgent cleansing to be rid of mostly western polluting influences. This premise
assumes that Sanskrit and Sanskrit culture are the single entry point of studying
Indian culture, past and present. The attempt is to revive the lost glory of Sanskrit
and return to that pristine past. This revivalist project is factually inaccurate
and conceptually flawed, as the principal motive is to claim, present and impose
a homogenised view of Indian history and culture and erode its universally
celebrated plural and syncretic elements.</p>

<p>No less worrying and problematic are the utterances, emanating from these
conferences regarding the antiquity and authorship of the Vedic literature,
projected as the root of everything Indian. An unbroken continuum of the Vedic
past is thus constructed and given the stamp of legitimacy almost like a cultural
brand-name. The next step is to pronounce India as the original homeland of
the Indo-Aryan speakers, who are erroneously and deliberately labeled as “the
Aryans”.</p>

<p>The use of “Aryan” as a biological label is palpably wrong. It is a language
label. Max Mueller in his monumental studies of the Vedas in mid-19th century
cautioned against confusing language labels with racial identities as was
being done with “the Aryans”. The term Aryan, occurs in a late 6th century
BCE inscription in Iran, and in the Rabatak inscription (from Afghanistan) of
Kanishka I (late first/early second century) as a language, not as an ethnic group.
Aryasatya, a foundational concept in Buddhism, refers to the four noble truths.
In the seventh century, Banabhatta, in his celebrated Harshacharita, branded
Pushyamitra Sunga, the Brahmin senapati of the Mauryas, as an anarya, because
he treacherously murdered his master, the last Maurya ruler, Brihadratha. Here,
anarya for Banabhatta is an ignoble person. The deliberately erroneous use of
Arya in an ethnic sense does not stand the scrutiny of historical evidence.
No less erroneous is the insistent claim that the original habitat of the speakers
of Indo-Aryan, and, presumably, its ancestral language of Indo-European, was
in the subcontinent. The problem becomes serious when some Sanskritists
project this argument by merely citing Rigvedic hymns. Little attention is paid
to the multiple studies on Indo-European and Indo-Aryan linguistics and on the
language of the Rigveda and that of the Avesta being cognates, which suggests
a shared common habitat of Indo-Iranian speakers before the bifurcation of the
Avestan and Vedic languages.</p>

<p>This has been consistently ignored by the India-as-the-home proponents. They
continue to critique the notion of an “Aryan invasion” of India, a long discarded
position since it was propounded by Mortimer Wheeler, a colonialist scholar. The
persistent abuse hurled at Romila Thapar for upholding the “Aryan Invasion”
theory only shows how poorly equipped her critics are, since she demonstrated
the inapplicability of the “Aryan invasion” theory way back in 1969!
The emerging image is the Indo-Aryan speakers reached the subcontinent by a
series of small scale migrations. In view of the well established findings that both
the Austro-Asiatic and Dravidian families of languages have greater antiquity
than the Indo-European/Indo-Aryan, it has been thought for long that some
linguistic elements were borrowed by the speakers of Indo-Aryan from Dravidian
speakers.</p>

<p>The same process seems to hold true for the presence of Mundari words in the
Rigveda. Such hybridity speaks volumes for the lively nature of the said speech
and the interactions among diverse linguistic groups. Language, like physical
types, is never pure or pristine and thrives on hybridity, a point effectively driven
home by the role played by Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit in subsequent centuries.
Sanskrit, great as the language is, has always been an elite language meant
for ritual, sacerdotal use, and courtly discourse. Cultural homogenisation
through centrestaging Sanskrit will lead to an infructuous understanding of
Indian culture, bereft of its plurality. The popularity of the Mahabharata and
the Ramayana, is due more to the wide appeal of the stories of the two epics
also available in vernacular literatures, as few were educated enough to read
and appreciate the Sanskrit of the epics. As we justly celebrate the marvels of
Sanskrit culture, let us not overlook the country’s equally rich vernacular and folk
cultures. One can justly celebrate Indian civilization because it is a civilization
upholding and championing cultural pluralities.</p>
