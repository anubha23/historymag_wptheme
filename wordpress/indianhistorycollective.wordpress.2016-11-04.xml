<strong>Interview with the historian Romila Thapar, Professor Emeritus, Jawaharlal Nehru University – RANABIR CHAKRAVARTI</strong>

Romila Thapar, Professor Emeritus, Jawaharlal Nehru University, is one of the most celebrated historians of India, internationally acclaimed particularly for her immense contribution to the interpretative studies of early India. Her untiring efforts have largely enabled the shift of the study from what is known as Indology to early Indian History with a strong orientation to social sciences. Her untiring engagement with the study of the history of this subcontinent are marked by interrogating and interpreting the past, not merely on empirical richness, but by integrating the study of ancient history with several social and human sciences such as sociology, social and cultural anthropology, geography and political science. The result has been the transformation of the study of ancient/early India from dynastic detail and dates to introspective readings of the past. In these ventures she repeatedly reminds us of the changing patterns of historiography and analyses the questions raised by historians, their methodologies of and approaches to the study of the past, which, as she rightly points out, is intimately linked up with the present. She has unravelled how a particular enquiry of the past has a bearing on the current social, cultural and political situation.

<strong>Ranabir Chakravarti:</strong> When one reads your latest book, The Past as Present, one gets an impression that you are a little sad about the state of the study of history, and the general perception of history, in India. You don’t sound very optimistic about it. You are not pessimistic either—that you wrote very clearly. Could you elaborate on the scenario?
<blockquote>“ We are still using a completely outdated understanding of history and methods of teaching it. The emphasis is on dates and events.”</blockquote>
<strong>Romila Thapar:</strong> Your question is about where history has gone in the last few decades in India. Let me say that there are two levels on which history is being read and studied or being spoken about. One is the level of the scholarship of academic historians where I think that the kind of history being written is impressive, at least among those historians who work at the better universities and colleges. When I consider how history was taught fifty years ago, and the kinds of struggles that we had in those days to give a new direction to historical writing, and the kind of direction that is now being taken, it is in fact an impressive change. I am pleased with the way things have gone, although admittedly the change is not universal in the universities and most have still not caught up with history as it is taught in the best centres. Nevertheless, there are a number of historians who not only treat history as a social science but also recognise its intellectual foundations. And this approach, one hopes, will spread.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Sanskrit has bequeathed to us wonderful literary treasures.</em>

<b>Cultural homogenisation through centrestaging Sanskrit will rob Indian culture of its plurality.</b>

Both print and electronic media have reported in recent weeks a number of conferences on Sanskrit language and culture. Promoting the study of Sanskrit language and texts are laudable efforts. Sanskrit has bequeathed to us wonderful literary treasures. However, the principal agenda of these conferences is not always the promotion of Sanskrit but establishing other perspectives of a problematic kind.

One persistently hears the persistent and shrill claim that Sanskrit and Sanskritic culture are the very bedrock of traditional, unadulterated and pristine Indian culture, which has been prevalent from time immemorial, but which needs an urgent cleansing to be rid of mostly western polluting influences. This premise assumes that Sanskrit and Sanskrit culture are the single entry point of studying Indian culture, past and present. The attempt is to revive the lost glory of Sanskrit and return to that pristine past. This revivalist project is factually inaccurate and conceptually flawed, as the principal motive is to claim, present and impose a homogenised view of Indian history and culture and erode its universally celebrated plural and syncretic elements.

No less worrying and problematic are the utterances, emanating from these conferences regarding the antiquity and authorship of the Vedic literature, projected as the root of everything Indian. An unbroken continuum of the Vedic past is thus constructed and given the stamp of legitimacy almost like a cultural brand-name. The next step is to pronounce India as the original homeland of the Indo-Aryan speakers, who are erroneously and deliberately labeled as “the Aryans”.

The use of “Aryan” as a biological label is palpably wrong. It is a language label. Max Mueller in his monumental studies of the Vedas in mid-19th century cautioned against confusing language labels with racial identities as was being done with “the Aryans”. The term Aryan, occurs in a late 6th century BCE inscription in Iran, and in the Rabatak inscription (from Afghanistan) of Kanishka I (late first/early second century) as a language, not as an ethnic group. Aryasatya, a foundational concept in Buddhism, refers to the four noble truths. In the seventh century, Banabhatta, in his celebrated Harshacharita, branded Pushyamitra Sunga, the Brahmin senapati of the Mauryas, as an anarya, because he treacherously murdered his master, the last Maurya ruler, Brihadratha. Here, anarya for Banabhatta is an ignoble person. The deliberately erroneous use of Arya in an ethnic sense does not stand the scrutiny of historical evidence.

No less erroneous is the insistent claim that the original habitat of the speakers of Indo-Aryan, and, presumably, its ancestral language of Indo-European, was in the subcontinent. The problem becomes serious when some Sanskritists project this argument by merely citing Rigvedic hymns. Little attention is paid to the multiple studies on Indo-European and Indo-Aryan linguistics and on the language of the Rigveda and that of the Avesta being cognates, which suggests a shared common habitat of Indo-Iranian speakers before the bifurcation of the Avestan and Vedic languages.

This has been consistently ignored by the India-as-the-home proponents. They continue to critique the notion of an “Aryan invasion” of India, a long discarded position since it was propounded by Mortimer Wheeler, a colonialist scholar. The persistent abuse hurled at Romila Thapar for upholding the “Aryan Invasion” theory only shows how poorly equipped her critics are, since she demonstrated the inapplicability of the “Aryan invasion” theory way back in 1969!

The emerging image is the Indo-Aryan speakers reached the subcontinent by a series of small scale migrations. In view of the well established findings that both the Austro-Asiatic and Dravidian families of languages have greater antiquity than the Indo-European/Indo-Aryan, it has been thought for long that some linguistic elements were borrowed by the speakers of Indo-Aryan from Dravidian speakers.

The same process seems to hold true for the presence of Mundari words in the Rigveda. Such hybridity speaks volumes for the lively nature of the said speech and the interactions among diverse linguistic groups. Language, like physical types, is never pure or pristine and thrives on hybridity, a point effectively driven home by the role played by Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit in subsequent centuries.

Sanskrit, great as the language is, has always been an elite language meant for ritual, sacerdotal use, and courtly discourse. Cultural homogenisation through centrestaging Sanskrit will lead to an infructuous understanding of Indian culture, bereft of its plurality. The popularity of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, is due more to the wide appeal of the stories of the two epics also available in vernacular literatures, as few were educated enough to read and appreciate the Sanskrit of the epics. As we justly celebrate the marvels of Sanskrit culture, let us not overlook the country’s equally rich vernacular and folk cultures. One can justly celebrate Indian civilization because it
is a civilization upholding and championing cultural pluralities.

The renowned historian recalls the nightmare of Partition and says the Emergency and Modi coming to power are, for him, the most traumatic events in India post-Independence.

Renowned historian Professor Irfan Habib, 84, recalls the nightmare of Partition and the assassination of Gandhi, his encounter with Nehru, the rise of communalism, the decline of the Left, and the ongoing fictionalisation of history under the NDA regime. Excerpts from an interview with Scroll.in.

<em>-By Aziz Ashraf</em>

What is your memory of the Partition and its impact on you and Aligarh?
I was 16 years old when Independence came. It was preceded by, as you know, the Muslim League’s domination of the Muslim constituency, including that of Aligarh. I inherited nationalistic feelings from my father (famous historian Mohammad Habib, 1895-1971), who belonged to the Congress. Because of the Muslim League I encountered considerable difficulties. For instance, I was pushed around when walking to and back from the school, which I ultimately left. But such incidents were minor in nature.

In comparison to the Partition riots, I suppose?
Yes. We were greatly worried as Aligarh used to border what is now Haryana, and the slaughter of Muslims had come up to the Yamuna. It was touch and go. In December 1947, we couldn’t even travel because it was unsafe for Muslims, many of whom were killed on trains.

Suddenly, Gandhiji’s fast in January (1948) in Delhi turned the situation upside down. Then, of course, in the same month, Gandhi was murdered. A massive demonstration was held in Aligarh the day after his assassination. It was my first experience of participating in a large demonstration, in which both the communists and socialists took part. It also happened to be my first communist demonstration.

Do you remember the slogans that were being chanted?
The Congress crowds were saying, Ishwar, Allah Tere hi naam, sabko sanmati de Bhagwan. (Ishwar and Allah are both Your names, please give everyone good sense). The communists and socialists and others were saying, Gandhi ke hathyaron ko, phaansi do, phaansi do. Mahasabha walon ko, phaansi do, phaansi do. (Hang the killers of Gandhi, Hang the Hindu Mahasabha people.) The houses of Hindu Mahasabha leaders had been attacked all over UP, in Aligarh as well. Everyone went around saying they (Mahasabha leaders) had distributed sweets; it fanned rumours. The distribution of sweets happened, of course. (Sardar) Patel records it, though he said someone’s nephew or niece had got married and the person was therefore distributing sweets.

Indeed, January 1948 was a great turning point for this area of India.

Is this why, in a lecture in Delhi earlier this year, you said, “If we want to truly understand Gandhi’s contribution to the building of modern India, then we should critically examine the events connected to the last four weeks before his assassination”?
Gandhi, unlike Nehru, was not a consistent thinker. In fact, Gandhi himself said that consistency wasn’t his strong point as he was after Truth. I hadn’t read Gandhi then. But you could see he was defending what is now called secular India, the term which Nehru and people like my father were already using. In fact, (the other day) I was reading my father’s address in December 1947 to the Indian History Congress in Bombay. He used the word secular, and said that Gandhiji was giving us a picture of secular India.

His fast was not only against the communal riotings, but also against India’s refusal to pay Rs 55 crore to Pakistan (under the terms and conditions pertaining to the division of assets and liabilities between the two countries). His was a remarkable action – he showed India would remain secular regardless of whatever happened in or with Pakistan.

But the Hindu Right criticises Gandhi for allowing the Partition and pandering to Muslims sentiments. He has been also called the mascot of the bourgeoisie. You now have the Ambedkarites criticising Gandhi for upholding the caste system.
As a historian, to understand Gandhi you have to understand what India was like in his times. We often forget that he came from a caste-ridden society. Since he has been extremely frank in his autobiography and expresses his feelings, even belittles himself all the time, it has become easy to criticise him, as [writer] Arundhati Roy and others are doing.

Gandhi was very honest in noting down what his feelings or opinions were at a particular point in time. But the fact is that he recognises it was a wrong thing. For instance, he talks of his initial repugnance of the Africans. He was honest, but he wasn’t a racist. Caste feelings were very strong in India then. You can’t be organising a mass movement against the British and yet say you will first abolish the caste system [before fighting the colonialism].

Gandhi can be easily accused of pandering to Muslim sentiments by his support to the Khilafat movement. But if Turkey hadn’t been supported, then British and French imperialism would have had the entire Asia in its tight grip. Lenin’s Russia, too, supported Turkey. If you look at the international scene then, the Khilafat movement was important, as was the non-cooperation movement with the British.

What you are saying is that Gandhi was trying to unite people on a common issue, despite their caste-religion-linguistic differences?
Yes. The main question then was: Was British imperialism the main target of the people, or was the main problem our own differences? If you don’t regard British imperialism as the basic problem or principal target, then why Gandhi, even Nehru, communists, everyone would be vulnerable to criticism.

So Arundhati Roy and others are using today’s wisdom to judge Gandhi’s responses to the issues of his times.
I don’t know whether you’d say Arundhati and others are using today’s wisdom or un-wisdom to judge Gandhi. It is only wisdom to recognise the reality as it existed then. Wisdom dictates that we should be proud that while Gandhi in South Africa thought women should stay at home, he was in 1945 saying they should become generals, that there should be no discrimination between them and men. We should be proud of that transformation, not only in Gandhi, but in the whole country.

Gandhi was constantly evolving. Do you think the Dalits didn’t accept the caste system in the 1920s? Even today, for marriage purposes, Dalits recognise and subscribe to the caste (subdivisions) among themselves. It is absurd to think that all issues should have been raised at the time the British were being opposed.

Weren’t you denied a passport because you were a communist activist?
In 1954-55, the Central government issued an advertisement inviting people to send their academic data for overseas scholarships. I applied, and on the basis of my academic data – I had a first division throughout – I was selected. I got admission to Oxford. But I was refused the passport until I agreed to surrender the scholarship.

That’s bizarre, quite like Catch 22!
(Laughs) So I wrote to Panditji (Jawaharlal Nehru). My wife and I drafted the letter together. I suppressed the fact that I was the son of one of his friends. However, it was on the basis of that letter Nehru called me and scolded me and….

Scolded you for what?
For being a communist, because, as he said, the communists don’t recognise Constitutionality. He criticised Russia and China, where he had just been to. He spoke for a long time, but said he couldn’t do anything because the matter of the passport was in Pandit GB Pant’s hands. However, I got the passport two days later.

Are you telling me, Nehru personally phoned you, a student then?
There was no phone in those days. The secretary to the Aligarh Muslim University Vice-Chancellor, Zakir Hussain (who became India’s third President), sent me a slip saying I should meet Nehru at 9 am in Delhi. I found no security, no guards…

I read Nehru as Prime Minister went to Regal Cinema in Connaught Place to watch the film, Of Human Bondage.
That was how it was then. I wasn’t frisked until I entered (private secretary OP) Mathai’s room.

Would you say the influence of orthodox elements on the Aligarh Muslim University, which has such a pull on Muslims even now, has grown over time, in comparison to what it was in your student days there?
First, we must remember that the Muslim League wasn’t orthodox. They were communal, but not religious. Jinnah was himself not religious. In fact, among the Muslims supporting the Congress, there were a large number of theologians, who began to dominate parts of government policy.

Did this impact Aligarh Muslim University adversely?
Yes, but there were also other reasons. When I was studying there, one-third of students were non-Muslim, as also one-fourth of teachers. Today, 90% are Muslims. There are very few non-Muslim teachers left now. They are simply weeded out in the recruitment process. There are a few Hindu students living in hostels. The change in AMU’s composition has changed its mentality.

In my student days, Diwali and Guru Nanak’s birthday were celebrated. Truckloads of ladoos would come from the city gurudwara to AMU. The atmosphere was different. Hindus and Muslims would really live together then. Today, that isn’t there. It has influenced everything.

In an essay in the Little Magazine, you wrote, “The Partition of India in 1947, accompanying independence, was undoubtedly a setback in the battle for minds, in which, as we have seen, the nation dwells.” Do you think the implications of that “setback in the battle for minds” continue to linger even today?
We lost the battle of minds in the sense we wanted to keep Hindus and Muslims together – but the Partition took place. In this battle the setback was greater (for secular nationalists) among Muslims than Hindus. Whatever you might say about the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, they were a very small minority of Hindus and were hardly elected. This you can’t, obviously, say of the Muslim League. Because of India’s secular democracy, Muslims gradually turned to the nation. I think the kind of irrational sympathy for Pakistan that existed when I was a student is hardly there any longer.

But, unfortunately, communalism has become very strong among the Hindus now.

Do you feel the Indian variant of secularism, in which the state allows all religions to flourish and discriminates against none, is undergoing a reversal? Is it time we move to the European idea of secularism
Actually, one of the difficulties, ideologically, is that we have rejected the global notion of secularism. The word secularism as used by Pandit Nehru, or by my father, was that religion would be excluded from the state, as it was in the French Revolution. The term was not used then, but the phenomenon was there. It was first used by (George Jacob) Holyoake (in 1851), who said secularism is morality without religion, without any idea of after-life. He also said secularism is linked to the idea of welfare (of people). This is the correct notion of secularism.

But the Radhakrishnan (Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, India’s second President) idea of secularism opens the door to majority communalism. It says all religions must be tolerated, which should be, but it also says religion can’t be separated from the state. There is nothing like an abstract religion. It is absurd to say that if we treat all religions equally, then religion can play a part in the state. Since there is no abstract religion, then only the majority religion can play a part.

This idea was upheld by the Supreme Court, which said instructions in religions should be there in all schools, despite the fact that the Constitution prohibits religious instructions in (government) schools. The judgement said it has to be allowed because all morality comes from sants and saints. This is historically a false statement. The sants and saints didn’t know about (social and economic) equality, gender equality. This kind of secularism is wrong. The global idea of secularism should have been upheld.

Why has the Left declined? Is it because, as it is often said, it didn’t factor the reality of caste in its strategies
Well, we can’t blame the country’s conditions. We can only blame ourselves. The communist movement did make many mistakes, the first of which was to support the demand for Pakistan. In 1948, we went in total opposition to the government and consequently destroyed much of the communist base. For instance, we opposed the Zamindari Abolition Act. We should have had a greater ideological campaign than we undertook, instead of concentrating on trade unions and peasant organisations so much.

It is easy to say caste was not factored in. In fact, all important communist leaders in Aligarh lived in what were then called Harijan bastis. We didn’t advertise it, we didn’t proclaim it. Nevertheless, as long as long as poverty and inequality exist, I can’t imagine the communist ideology not having an appeal for the nation.

You have been quoted saying the present Modi regime is attempting “not saffronisation, but fictionalisation of history”. How do you distinguish the two terms?
In history, it is possible to have different interpretations from the same set of facts. If there are a large number of facts available, as would be, say, in the 19th and 20th century history, then selection becomes very important. When we don’t have a large number of facts, because of disappearance of records, then you have only a partial knowledge of the past. In the latter case, different interpretations are possible. Now interpretations based on historical facts or data could be communal or non-communal, Marxist or post-modernist, etc. So long as you are dealing with recognised historical facts, you can argue your case.

For instance, RC Majumdar was a communal person. He had very harsh things to say about Gandhiji. But he was a historian, he dealt with facts. He refused to write for the Organiser when the RSS wanted him to endorse its theory that the Mughal monuments were not built by the Mughals. He thought it was nonsense. One still argues with Majumdar because he is a historian – and a tall historian at that. But what the RSS is promoting is fiction.

Can you cite some examples of what you call the fictionalisation of history?
This Saraswati mania, for instance. A river of such a large size could have been possible perhaps five million years ago, though I have my doubts about even that. But it is an absurdity to conceive that such a large river flowed through the Thar desert in 3000 BC. This is an example of fiction.

Why is the RSS obsessed with the Saraswati river?
They have this obsession because they want to present history that would suit the RSS ideology. That ideology, of course, is that the Hindus, particularly of Brahminical persuasion, had a glorious past, that they even had plastic surgery.

But where does the obsession with Saraswati fit into this?
This is because when you say the Indus civilisation or Harappan civilisation, then, for them, it becomes a problem. Harappa is in Pakistan, the Indus flows mainly in Pakistan. Since we have recognised the Partition, and given away a part of Bharat Desh, they must have the Saraswati (and so the Saraswati civilisation). You will be surprised to learn that the Geological Survey of India, during the first National Democratic Alliance government, issued a book in which it showed that the Saraswati river doesn’t enter Pakistan. In fact, the river is shown avoiding Pakistan altogether to flow through the deserts of Rajasthan. This is for you the Geological Survey of India.

In an essay you once wrote, you said, “What is of primary interest to us today is to ask whether there is still a case for India as a nation.” Has the case for India as a nation become stronger or weaker?
A nation is how we construct it; a nation is not a natural thing. You create a sense of (national) community and within it, little communities. And if we promote sectional divisions or regional divisions, to that extent the nation is weakened or affected adversely. So a nation has to be built up. One of the most important ways of sustaining the nation is secularism and democracy and paying attention to different regions and meeting their needs. The problem with the present government is that it lacks inclusiveness, which is necessary for the construction of a nation. So they may shout they are nationalists, but they are in fact undermining the nation.

What to you is the significance of Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister?
I must confess I never thought he would become the Prime Minister. I think I had what now seems to me a very idealistic picture of the Indian electorate. I was mistaken. The Indian electorate is just like any other electorate in the world. But, certainly, propaganda and some hope that he would be different from others were factors behind his victory. But one must also realise that the RSS ideology is spreading, particularly in the middle classes.

Finally, in your opinion what has been the most traumatic event in India post-Independence?
(Laughs) For me personally, the declaration of the Emergency was one of them. Next to it is the coming of Modi to power.

		<title>Searching for the Saraswati</title>

<div class="entry">
<div class="articleLead"><i>One set of Saraswati enthusiasts wants to lead the river to ancient Prayag, while the other would like it to flow parallel to the Indus.</i></div>
<p class="body">On March 31, 2015, <i>The Hindu </i>carried a report of a plan by the Haryana government to <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/excavation-to-begin-in-search-of-saraswati/article7050382.ece"><b>recreate the Saraswati river</b></a>, apparently because the present river of the name Sarsuti does not possess features expected of what is presumed to have been a great river of sacred lore. At the place officially determined to be the site of origin of the stream, which falls in Haryana, extensive “excavation” is being undertaken to locate the exact spot where the river was formed. Why excavation is necessary for this purpose is not clear: perhaps, the wielding of spades is expected to lead to a natural spring. In case this does not happen, there is a Plan B. “Two or three tube wells” will be dug to create an official spring. Should this not be sufficient to form even a rivulet, let alone a majestic river, there is a convenient ‘drain’ nearby, which would be diverted into the artificial channel. The official mind has apparently overlooked the fact that the actual source of the holy river would then shift from the present site in Haryana to the source of the drain, which might well be situated in some nullah coming down from Himachal Pradesh and, by this unfortunate circumstance, shift the source of the river Saraswati to a place outside Haryana.</p>
<p class="body">While determined to celebrate the rising of Saraswati within its borders, the Haryana government also seems mindful of where the waters of the Saraswati, once set in motion from wells and drain, are to be led. The natural slope here is south-westerly, but the official hand will lead the waters firmly south-eastwards to make the river run to Allahabad, the ancient Prayag, in Uttar Pradesh. The local legend in Prayag is that an invisible Saraswati joins the Ganga-Yamuna Sangam, exactly where the two rivers meet. It would be too sanguine to expect the Haryana government to make a tunnel all the way to Allahabad, well over 500 kilometres long, to keep the river invisible in conformity with tradition. But even making a visible Saraswati run to Allahabad over and across the Yamuna and the various Doab streams will take some doing.</p>
<p class="body"><b>Capturing the name first</b></p>
While the practical impediments to the Haryana government’s seeming design to carry Saraswati to Prayag take one’s breath away, it will surely still not satisfy those who have a different vision for Saraswati, a vision opposite to what the holy legend at Prayag dictates. Seers like Acharya David Frawley, recent recipient of the Padma Bhushan, and ‘NASA scientist’ Navratna S. Rajaram, spokesman of the ‘Indo-American’ school of history, seem to spurn the connection with Prayag by assigning to Saraswati the duty rather of winning the Indus civilisation for India. For this patriotic purpose, the Saraswati must be conceived to have been, as late as 5,000 years ago, one of the great rivers of the world, flowing down to the Rann of Kutch, parallel to the Indus. The Indus Valley Civilisation, whose two major cities Mohenjo Daro and Harappa unfortunately lie in Pakistan, can then be renamed the Saraswati Civilisation and, on that ground, claimed for India.
<p class="body">This battle for name capture was launched well over 20 years ago. In 1995, Prof. V.N. Misra, Director of Deccan College in Pune, the major centre for archaeological research in India, contributed an article to that luminous journal, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s<i>Manthan</i>, titled ‘The Lost Sarasvati, the Cradle of Harappan Civilisation’. The next year, S.P. Gupta, patron of the Indian Archaeological Society, titled his book on the Indus civilisation<i>The Indus-Sarasvati Civilisation</i>. Half the battle in the name capture has, thus, already been won but, of course, to sustain it and restore the Saraswati as a great river, we must come up with some evidence.</p>
<p class="body">Here, the Sangh Parivar intellectuals almost uniformly invoke verses from the Rigveda, where the Saraswati is conceived of as a great river, flowing from the mountains (<i>giri</i>) to the ocean (<i>samudra</i>). It seems like the poets are actually imagining Saraswati as the river-goddess rather than an actual river; alternatively, as has been proposed by Rudolf von Roth, Heinrich Zimmer and K.C. Chattopadhyaya, Saraswati here represents the Indus. Clearly, the present-day Saraswati in Haryana neither rises in the Himalayas nor flows down to the sea. Its connection with the Ghaghar is possibly relatively recent (14th century), and so even its link with the Hakra, the dry river of the desert (through the Ghaghar bed), is hardly as certain as everyone seems to assume.</p>
<p class="body"><b>Two difficult alternatives</b></p>
The suggestion has therefore been made that the present Saraswati was once upon a time converted into a Himalayan river because for some period the Yamuna and Sutlej became its tributaries. However, should such a junction have occurred in historical times, the Saraswati itself would have been a tributary of the Yamuna or Sutlej rather than the other way around. Moreover, the scrutiny of alluvium from excavations in the Ghaghar plain by Marie-Agnes County’s team in 1983-87 ruled out the presence, within the present Holocene times (the last 10,000 years), of any large river coming down from the Himalayas into the area.
<p class="body">Thus, given a choice between the older mythology of Prayag as the destination of the Saraswati, and the latest one of a Saraswati rivalling the Indus, the Haryana government has to decide between two equally daunting alternatives. But it might, perhaps, still consider a genuinely ancient version of the Saraswati lore, which imposes no such burden of work on it at all.</p>
<p class="body">The Rigveda in its River Hymn (X. 75.5) puts Saraswati without any adjectives between the Yamuna and Shutudri (Sutlej). This suits the present Sarsuti. The Panchavimsha Brahmana and other early texts speak of the Saraswati’s disappearance at Vinashana, which means that it did not then join the Ghaghar, but ran in a more southerly direction, probably running past Sirsa (medieval name: Sarsati), the place obviously named after the river itself. Vinashana lay presumably further south within Haryana. The<i>Manusmriti</i>, 2.17, proclaimed the zone of Saraswati and Drishadvati (Chautang?) as the holy land of Brahmavarta; and so the course of Saraswati, as described above, would make Brahmavarta correspond exactly to Haryana.</p>
<p class="body">From ancient tradition itself we thus have a depiction of the Saraswati that mocks neither geography nor history. Why, then, need anyone try to stretch Saraswati to either Allahabad or the Rann of Kutch? Obviously, purposes other than those of reason and common sense are at work.</p>

		<title>Interview with Hermann Kulke, Professor Emeritus of South and South-East Asian History in Kiel University, Germany.</title>

PROFESSOR Hermann Kulke’s is arguably one of the most important names in the study of premodern Indian history. Born in 1938 in Berlin, he is currently Professor Emeritus of South and South-East Asian History at the Department of History, Kiel University, Germany, where he was professor from 1988 to 2005. After receiving his PhD in Indology from Freiburg University in 1967, he taught for 21 years at the South Asia Institute (SAI) of Heidelberg University. He was a founding member of the prestigious Orissa Research Project (ORP) of the German Research Council from 1970 to 1975, and was coordinator of the second ORP from 1999 to 2005.

One who began in the best traditions of classical German Indology, Professor Kulke brought to bear on his subject the rigour and discipline of social sciences. He also challenged boldly the two dominant models which sought to explain the “early medieval” in Indian history—those of Indian feudalism and segmentary state. Basing his generalisations largely in the specific context of Odisha, he put forward what is called the “The Processual Model of Integrative State Formation”. Besides this, Professor Kulke made significant interventions in the study of the so-called “Indianised states” of South-East Asia and also about the rise of the Vijayanagara state. He was a visiting professor at Utkal University, Bhubaneswar (1978-1979), the Asiatic Society, Kolkata (1986), and Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi (1992). He was also the Fellow of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore (1987) and of the Asia Research Institute of the University of Singapore (2007). In 2005, he received the Gold Medal of the Asiatic Society of Kolkata. When the President of India decorated him with the title of Padma Shri in 2010, those who knew his work thought it was an honour that had come too late. The President of Germany awarded him the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2011.

Living in the sleepy village of Heikendorf in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, Professor Kulke is now engaged in preparing the sixth edition of <i>History of India,</i> which he wrote with Professor Deitmar Rothermund; the second edition of <i>State in India,</i> which Oxford University Press had published; and the second edition of <i>Precolonial India: Issues and Debates, </i>prepared in collaboration with Professor B.P. Sahu.

Professor Kesavan Veluthat of the University of Delhi talked with Professor Kulke extensively in Kiel and Heikendorf in the last week of April 2015. Excerpts from the interview:

<b>Professor Kulke, let me first of all thank you for agreeing to spend some time for Frontline.</b>

<b>Let us begin from the beginning. You were trained in the best traditions of German Indology although you took it to greater heights and made it an authentic part of social sciences. Can you tell us something about German Indology itself—its beginnings, compulsions and achievements?</b>

German Indology was a child of German romanticism and idealism of the early 19th century and, as a reaction to rationalism in the Age of Enlightenment, a search of a lost time and the origins of folk traditions and mythologies, which one expected to find in the harmonious combination of spiritualism and rationalism of Indian wisdom and philosophy by a scientific study of Sanskrit as the assumed origin of the Indo-European [“Indo-Germanic”] languages. Since 1818, when Wilhelm Schlegel became the first German professor of Indology at Bonn University, more and more professorships of Indology were established at German universities; in the late 20th century, about one and a half dozen, in comparison to four in Great Britain. The major foci of German Indology were linguistics, Vedic studies, philosophy and religious studies. The best known German Indologist in India is, of course, Max Mueller at Oxford University, who edited the monumental series <i>Sacred Book of the East </i>and, for the first time, the Rgveda. But it is less known that epigraphical studies, too, were a major emphasis of German Indology. Thus, the doyen of Indian epigraphy, D.C. Sircar, dedicated in 1965 his comprehensive <i>Indian Epigraphy</i> to three German Indologists [Georg Buehler, Lorenzo Franz Kielhorn, Eugen Hultzsch] and one British Indologist [John Faithfull Fleet]. When once I asked Prof. Sircar at his residence in Kolkata why he selected three Germans, he answered: “They were the greatest.” And he then told me that Hultzsch, the first chief epigraphist of the Archaeological Survey of India from 1886 to 1903, was so popular among his Indian colleagues that they called him “Mr H U and six consonants”. But despite its undeniable merits, German Indology of the late 19th and early 20th centuries has been contaminated by its contribution to the creation of the “Aryan Myth”, which became a major ideological prop of German fascism with all its racist madness.

<b>How did you, first of all, get interested in India and Indian studies? Who among the German Indologists inspired you most? Did you have other sources of inspiration in Indian studies? And, did your inspiration derive also from the developments in social sciences in Germany and Europe at large, apart from Indian studies?</b>

Initially in 1959, the major fields of my studies were medieval German history, sociology and political science. But soon I became interested in early Indian history and culture and began to study Sanskrit and Indology, which finally became my major subjects. Among the German Indologists, I was influenced, for example, by Heinrich Zimmer’s<i>Indian Philosophy</i>, Helmuth von Glasenapp’s study of Hinduism, Wilhelm Rau’s Vedic studies and Paul Hacker’s Purana studies. At this time, I was also strongly influenced by India’s dominant role in the so-called “Third World Movement”. My “paradigmatic shift” was influenced by a two-month stay in 1961 as a young tutorial assistant in a study project on a Buddhist vihara in Sri Lanka. The following one month, a third-class train trip through India was particularly seminal for me, a “tirtha yatra” [pilgrimage] to many places from Rameswaram, Madurai, Mahabalipuram [Mamallapuram], Kancheepuram, Badami, Ellora, Ajanta, Sanchi, Khajuraho, Varanasi and Agra, where I celebrated at the Taj Mahal my 23rd birthday on a night of a full moon, and finally Amritsar and Lahore. My <i>tirtha yatra </i>was completed by an exciting hitch-hike across the Khyber Pass.

<b>Your first major work, published in 1970, is on Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu. Most of the temple studies available at that time were either descriptive or hagiographical. How far do you think you have gone beyond that and how did you achieve it?</b>

Since my <i>tirtha yatra</i> I became deeply interested in the social and political significance of religious institutions in India. Initially, under the impression of Ellora, Ajanta and Sanchi, I had been thinking of taking up a study of the sociopolitical causes of the decline of Buddhism in India. But finally, the unique temple cities gained the upper hand. My choice of Chidambaram was strongly influenced by Prof. V. Raghavan during my stay at Madras University in 1963. In my translation and text-critical study of the<i>Cidambaramahatmya,</i> I detected several originally separate layers of competing Vaishnava and Saiva groups of Chidambaram’s priesthood and a strong influence of the Cholas who worshipped Nataraja as their <i>istadevata</i>. I am thankful to my Indological “doctor father”, Prof. Ulrich Schneider at Freiburg University, for supporting this kind of “socio-Indological” studies, which were at that time still very unusual in traditional German Indology.

<b>ORISSA RESEARCH PROJECT</b>

<b>After this major study, you left the field of south India and started concentrating on Odisha and eastern India. What prompted you to make this shift, particularly when there was considerable potential in the history of south India—the kind of history you have been doing?</b>

Your question is justifiable. The shift from Chidambaram and its Dikshitars to Puri was initially not easy for me, particularly after they had arranged for me in 1970 the great honour to present my PhD thesis, <i>Cidambaramahatmya</i>, personally to Nataraja [the presiding deity] at his Chitsabha [the sanctum sanctorum].  The German members of the two Orissa Research Projects [1970-1975 and 1999-2005] were even not allowed to enter the compound of the Jagannatha temple, and Prof. G.C. Tripathi and I handed over in 1979 the report of our first ORP, “The Cult of Jagannath and the Regional Tradition of Orissa”, to the temple administrator of Puri. The major reason for the shift from south India to Odisha was that the initial idea of a three-month study tour of south Indian temple cities by the Department of Indology of Freiburg University was given up because of the lack of knowledge of Tamil. In 1970, the project in Odisha was initially planned as a short comparative study of the Saiva Lingaraja and the Vaishnava Jagannatha temple. But owing to its encouraging possibilities, the ORP soon developed into a full-fledged study of the cult of Jagannatha.

<b>Your formulation on the cult of Jagannatha and its role in legitimising the political formation in Odisha under the Gajapatis has been seminal. It threw open potentials of looking at the process of state formation in a way different from what others have done. Here, will you elaborate a little on the way in which your perceptions differ from those of other scholars? In other words, how would you look at ideas of Indian feudalism, segmentary state, and so on?</b>

The persistence of the Gajapati kingship ideology since the 12th century until today and its spread to the two dozen feudatory states of Odisha is indeed unique. It offers a wide spectrum of paradigmatic studies on the role of religion and legitimation in processes of state formation from tribal chieftaincies to subregional “little kingdoms” and “regional empires”. Since my study at Freiburg University in the 1960s, Max Weber’s concepts of legitimation and his analysis of the successive development stages from local patriarchal authority to extended patrimonial rule and to its large-scale expansion by the build-up and control of an extra-patrimonial administration were of particular relevance for me. These ideas were helpful during my discovery of and “confrontation” with the seemingly confusing but fascinating processes and facets of early state formation in Odisha.

My studies in Odisha have been deeply influenced by critical and beneficial dialogues with Indian colleagues about existing concepts of state formation. Soon, I came also under the influence of Indian feudalism and the segmentary state, the two dominant concepts of contemporary discourses in India. R.S. Sharma was the first to emphasise the important role of land donation to Brahmins and temples in processes of early state formation. But in the course of my studies in Odisha, it turned out that these donations caused processes of sociocultural and economic integration rather than feudal fragmentation of formerly centralised kingdoms. Burton Stein’s emphasis of the persistent existence of autonomous local nuclear areas [the <i>nadu</i>s in south India] was another important epistemological tool for the analysis of basic structures of early states not only in south India but in Odisha, too. But the results of my studies in Odisha disproved Stein’s idea that royal authority remained confined only to ritual sovereignty, whereas the actual political control was firmly and persistently embedded only in these nuclear areas. Odisha’s Gajapati kingship ideology proved to be a successful ritual policy rather than a weak ritual sovereignty of a segmentary state.

As a result of my research in Odisha, I delineated, in collaboration with my Indian colleagues—Prof. B.D. Chattopadhyaya of JNU and Prof. B.P. Sahu of Delhi University—“The Processual Model of Integrative State Formation”. It depicts various processes of progressing state formation instead of the construction of an encompassing model of the state. Its major characteristic is the bottom-up perception of the state with a strong emphasis of its local and subregional ingredients in its final regional manifestation. The top-down discernment perceives instead subregional polities as weak tributary reflections or even fragments of the regional kingdom and neglects locally still existing social and cultural identities. With its regionally dominant tribal societies and the large number of subregional little kingdoms, the Garhjat [“castle-born”] Mahals and future “princely states”, Odisha offers an ideal arena for the study of the “processual model of integrative state formation”. It is paradigmatically reflected in the rise of powerful tribal<i>thakurani</i>s to <i>istadevata</i>s of the Garhjat Mahals and, finally, to Jagannatha, the<i>rastradevata</i> of the “imperial” Gajapati kings of Puri.

<b>You have used madalapanji, mahatmya, vamsavali, etc., extensively. What do you have to say about the methodology using such material for historical reconstruction? And to what extent are they records of historical consciousness?</b>

As a heritage of its late medieval and early modern history and culture, Odisha owns a considerable number of traditional accounts. But they are usually treated as stepchildren of anthropological and Indological studies as they represent neither the genuine local village culture nor the Brahmin-dominated elite culture, the respective favourite children of anthropologists and Indologists. Historians, too, avoid or even reject them entirely because of their peculiar blending of mythological, legendary and occasionally historical accounts. But we may arrive at a very different assessment if we appraise them as “melting pots” of the great all-Indian and the local “little” traditions. They depict hitherto neglected aspects of “localisation” of great traditions on the one hand and “trans-localisation” of local traditions on the other. They are of particular relevance for the study of subregional and regional history and identities and, as pointed out by Prof. Romila Thapar, they embody a vibrant historical consciousness.

Moreover, contrary to the general opinion, these anonymous traditional accounts, like for example the dynastic “royal” <i>vamsavali</i>s of the feudatory states of Odisha, contain important material for historical studies. In order to have access to this mythologically “embedded” material, we have to distinguish three successive layers of these texts, that is, a mythological, a legendary and a historical section with their own distinct significance and textual history. For a historical analysis, it is essential to date, if possible, the layers of these undated texts. If we succeed in dating them at least approximately, we are able to discover and extract hitherto unknown historical or semi-historical data from these texts and to correlate them with other historically dated sources. Apart from discovering hitherto unknown historical data in these traditional accounts, it is particularly revealing to detect the political-dynastic, social or religious circumstances of their composition. Traditional accounts often indicate political and religious contestation between rival social groups which are undocumented in Brahmanically redacted texts. They are instruments of influence and sociocultural domination and, rarely, means of rule. It is, therefore, of particular relevance to ask, who has written it for whom under which sociopolitical circumstances.

<i>Madala Panji</i>, Puri’s famous temple chronicle and dynastic history of Odisha, is a special case. As its date is still a matter of controversial debates, it had once been completely rejected as a genuine historical source. Traditional historians link its initial composition to the age of Chodaganga, the founder of the present Jagannatha temple in the 12th century. But more recently, I suggested that it was composed only in the late 16th century after the cult had been renewed by Ramachandra of Khurda after its destruction by the Afghan general Kalapahar in 1568. Its major intention was the verification of the uninterrupted existence of the Jagannatha cult and the legitimation of Ramachandra’s claim to be the heir apparent of Odisha’s erstwhile imperial Gajapatis. Its mythological section is significant for Odisha’s traditional historical consciousness and identity, whereas the semi-historical section of the post-Chodaganga age contains legendary but also important historical information. The third section of the 17th and 18th centuries is the most important indigenous historical source of this age. In all matters of these traditional accounts, I am thankful to my friends and colleagues in Odisha, particularly Prof. G.N. Dash, who has accompanied my studies with helpfully critical attention since 1970.

<b>STATE FORMATION IN INDIA</b>
<b>
How would you look at the process of state formation in India as linked to the emergence of regions?</b>

Regions emerged from their own dynamics and self-reinforcing tendencies of regional state formation. This development was the genuine subcontinental Indian process of state formation in post-Asokan and pre-Delhi Sultanate history, which was interrupted only by the north Indian Gupta empire. In fact, I regard the age of the great regional kingdoms and cultures as the culmination of Indian state formation as it granted its culturally prolific regions an equal share in the pan-Indian processes of state formation and cultural development. India’s proclaimed “unity in diversity” is based on the interlinked emergence of regional cultures.

<b>The notion of integrative polity seems to have explanatory potential going beyond Odisha, particularly in regions where the institution of state is making its appearance for the first time. Do you think this will apply to all regions at all times, not just in the case of India?</b>

Odisha played a significant role in the emergence of the processual model of integrative state formation. But it has other godparents, too, like Bengal and Rajasthan and has certainly good chances to be applied also to other regions of South Asia. Its applicability increases in areas where sources of the existence and involvement of tribal and post-tribal polities in processes of early state formation are still available. Odisha was, therefore, an ideal arena to develop the integrative concept. A major problem of other regions is that their histories have been and still are overshadowed by traditional dynastic histories which marginalise or even eliminate the historical existence of pre-state polities. The integrative concept has already been tentatively applied to processes of early state formation in South-East Asia. But its applicability to its great medieval kingdoms is constrained by their royal top-down foundation.

<b>If a model can thus explain everything, will it not fail to account for specificities? Does it not lose its explanatory potential?</b>

Models are epistemological tools that should never try to “explain everything”. R.S. Sharma was wise enough not to extend his feudalism model beyond 1300 C.E., whereas Burton Stein made the mistake [which he partly corrected] of applying his segmentary state model to south Indian history from the early Pallavas to Vijayanagara and thus even to the “imperial century” of Chola rule in the 11th century. The processual model, too, should not try to explain all aspects of early medieval state formation by integration. As has rightly been pointed out, tribal cults were not only integrated but sometimes also appropriated for royal legitimation. Models and their proponents should always be open to constructive critique, which was not always the case with all proponents of the concepts of Indian feudalism and the segmentary state.

<b>SOUTH-EAST ASIA</b>

<b>After your considerable work on India, which finds its tour de force in “History of India” that you and Dietmar Rothermund wrote, you seem to have taken a keener interest in South-East Asia. Given the kind of new interest that the world of scholars has bestowed on South-East Asia, how would you look at your own intervention? Does the model that you have found successful in the case of India apply there as well?</b>

My interest and studies in the south-east was from the very beginning strongly interrelated with my studies in south India and Odisha. Inspired by my studies on the “temple policy” of the Cholas in Chidambaram and Tanjavur, I took up in 1968 the study on the apotheosis of Hindu kingship in Angkor and its Devaraja cult. On the basis of my research on the Jagannatha cult in Odisha since 1970, I published a comprehensive article in 1974 in German and in 1978 at Cornell University, in which I contradicted the largely accepted perception that the kings of Angkor were deified as <i>deva</i>.  But like the Gajapatis of Odisha and the Cholas, they were earthly representatives of Siva, who was the “King of the gods” [Devaraja]. On special occasions, the Devaraja was worshipped by a <i>calanti pratima</i>, like Lingaraja in Bhubaneswar. My successive studies on processual state formation, too, began explicitly with a comparative approach of India and South-East Asia with emphasis on Odisha and Java. These studies were reflected for the first time in 1986 at the National University of Australia in a paper, “The Early and the Imperial Kingdom in Southeast Asia History”. In the following years, this concept was further developed and it emerged finally in 1995, again under strong Odishan and south Indian influence, as the already introduced “processual model of integrative state formation in India”.

Moreover, the comparative study of processes of state formation on both sides of the Bay of Bengal provided the basis for my “convergence theory”, yet another concept strongly influenced by the history and culture of Tamil Nadu and Odisha. The spread of Indian culture to South-East Asia, the so-called Indianisation, was not the work of Indian princes who founded “Hindu Colonies in the Far East”, as assumed by Indian historians like R.C. Majumdar in the age of the Indian national Independence movement. It was the cultural convergence on both sides of the Bay of Bengal in mid-first millennium C.E. that made the model of early state formation in eastern and southern India attractive to local rulers of South-East Asia. They invited Brahmins as honoured and learned “development aid workers” to their courts, just as early south Indian local rulers had invited north Indian Brahmins. The emergence of temple architecture in South-East Asia, only few generations later than in southern and eastern India, is another example of cultural convergence in the context of early state formation on both sides of the Bay of Bengal.

<b>How would you assess the state of knowledge in relation to premodern Indian history?</b>

According to my assessment of the results of recent research on early or pre-colonial history of India, a historical and a historiographical issue comes to my mind:

(i) The emergence of regional statehood and the integrative mode of state formation were dominant historical development trajectories not only during the 600 years of the post-Gupta and pre-Delhi Sultanate age. Until the rise of the Mughals in mid-16th century, regional state formation continued to flourish even in the age of the Delhi Sultanate, for instance, under the Gajapatis of Odisha, in Vijayanagara in south India and in Mewar in Rajasthan.

(ii) According to the traditional tripartite periodisation of Ancient, Medieval and Modern History, the distinct age of the dominant regional kingdoms and their great regional cultures is still attributed to “Ancient India”.  But this period has rightly been signified as an age <i>sui generis</i> by Prof. B.D. Chattopadhyaya in his seminal book <i>The Making of Early Medieval India</i> (1994). As “early medieval” has, meanwhile, widely been accepted, it would be only appropriate to designate the period of the Delhi Sultanate as “late medieval”, taking into consideration both its part continuity with the early medieval period and its new sociopolitical and military modes of temporary subcontinental rule. We may then go even a step further in re-conceptualising the periodisation of pre-colonial India and assign “Mughal India” not any longer to Medieval India but designate it as “Early Modern”. In this case, too, we will have to take into consideration continuity and change. Continuity with the Delhi Sultanate, particularly under its last Sur dynasty, and with regional state formation in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu under the Nayaks and the rise of the Marathas. Change not only in view of the intrusion of early European colonial states but particularly with regard to the new “early modern” imperial administration of the Mughals as a major prerequisite of the “modern” British Raj in India since mid-18th century.
